# Pick wallpaper using sxiv

# All the options here may make the script look complicated, but in reality you just change the wallpaper location and wpsetter if you want, and then use the command.
# Requirements by default:
# sxiv
# dmenu



# Location of wallpapers contains folders named after category, which you can then pick from with dmenu or by passing a folder name as $1

# Example layout

#└── walls
#    ├── category-1
#    │   ├── file-2.png
#    │   └── file.png
#    ├── category-2
#    │   └── file-3.png
#    └── category-3
#        └── file-69.png

# Choosing category-1 from dmenu would result in sxiv showing file.png and file-2.png
# Using the command "pickwall category-2" would result in sxiv showing file-3.png
# And using the command "pickwall all" would result in sxiv showing file.png, file-2.png, file-3.png and file-69.png

# If this is too complicated, you are truly retarded.

# Folders with a % sign in their name are hidden in the menu

# You can change pretty much everything here

loc="$WALLPAPERS" # Location containing image folders, $WALLPAPERS is set by my dotfiles
wpsetter="setbg" # Command that image is passed to as an argument
menu="dmenu -l 20" # Command with dmenu like functionality
picker="sxiv -tbor" # Command for picking images, i don't know why someone would use anything else than sxiv for this, but it's a possibility
all="all" # Argument to show all wallpaper categories at once

[ ! -z "$1" -a "$1" != "$all" ] && "$wpsetter" "$($picker "$loc"/"$1")"
